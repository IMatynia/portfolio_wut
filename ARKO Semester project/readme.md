# ARKO - Architektura komputer√≥w / Computer architecture

In this folder are located 3 stages of my semester project. The task was to mark the brightest NxM rectangle of the bitmap with a red rectangle. Names of the subfolders reflect the architecture used in writing assembler code. In the case of x86, we also got to use GDB debugger.
