In this project we were tasked with creating a cookbook website's backend in microservice architecture. We used SpringBoot services, that operated independently on separate docker container instances. Additionally the system used a postgresql database, minio object storage and elasticsearch database for recipie lookup. I was involved in coding the user, recipie-crud and image storage services.
