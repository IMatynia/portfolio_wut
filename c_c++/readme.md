Group semester project in object-oriented programming. All code is written in C++. Our task was to create a simulation of a vinyl record shop. Additional information is available in "sprawozdanie.pdf".

# SOI - systemy operacyjne / operating systems
> 2022Z

Technologies:
- c++
- low level linux/unix api 
- multiprocessing and synchronization

In this folder are some of my project from operating systems course. We studied, among other things, how to properly handle parallel processing and the inner workings of file systems. All code is in C/C++.

In `semaphores` folder are located 2 projects where our task was to create a communications buffer between multiple processes running in parallel. One was meant to be implemented using simple semaphores, and the other using a monitor. Additional implementation info is available in corresponding "dokumentacja.pdf" files.

In `file system` folder is located my virtual file system written in C. The task was to implement some virtual hard drive with 1-folder deep file system, that could load/extract files to and from the host machine. Additional information and analisys of my implementation is in "dokumentacja.pdf"
